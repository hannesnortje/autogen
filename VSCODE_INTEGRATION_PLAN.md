## Future Recommendations

### Enhancements for Step 19 (WebSocket/Real-time)
- **WebSocket Robustness**: Add reconnection logic with exponential backoff for better resilience against network issues
- **Live Status Indicators**: Add visual "Live" badges in session dashboards and status bar to indicate active WebSocket connections
- **Progress Detail Display**: Show specific `progress_step` values and timestamps in dashboard UI, not just trigger refreshes
- **Focused WebSocket Tests**: Add unit tests specifically for WebSocket connection handling, message processing, and UI automatic updates

### Dashboard Enhancements
- **Real-time Session Details**: Display live agent activity, current tasks, and progress metrics in session dashboards
- **Performance Metrics**: Add charts for session duration, message frequency, and agent response times
- **Memory Visualization**: Create interactive memory exploration with search result highlighting and relevance scoring
- **Export Capabilities**: Enhanced session data export with filtering options and multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
- **Theme Support**: Better integration with VS Code themes and customizable dashboard layouts
- **Notification Center**: Centralized view for session events, errors, and important updates

### Extension Architecture Improvements
- **Settings Management**: More granular configuration options for WebSocket timeouts, refresh intervals, and UI preferences
- **Error Recovery**: Better handling of server disconnections with automatic retry and user feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading for large session lists and memory data pagination
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support for all UI components

### Integration Opportunities
- **File System Watchers**: Auto-sync workspace file changes to memory service (Step 20 foundation)
- **Git Integration**: Automatic commit creation for agent-generated code changes
- **Multi-workspace Support**: Handle multiple VS Code workspaces with separate MCP server instances
- **Extension API**: Expose hooks for other extensions to integrate with AutoGen sessions

### Testing and Quality
- **E2E Testing**: Complete user workflow tests from session start to file generation
- **Load Testing**: Validate performance with multiple concurrent sessions and large memory datasets
- **Cross-platform Testing**: Ensure consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and VSIX packaging for marketplace distribution

### Documentation Improvements
