### Extension Architecture Improvements
- **WebSocket Robustness**: Add reconnection logic with exponential backoff for better resilience against network issues
- **Live Status Indicators**: Add visual "Live" badges in session dashboards and status bar to indicate active WebSocket connections
- **Progress Detail Display**: Show specific `progress_step` values and timestamps in dashboard UI, not just trigger refreshes
- **Focused WebSocket Tests**: Add unit tests specifically for WebSocket connection handling, message processing, and UI automatic updates

### Dashboard Enhancements
- **Real-time Session Details**: Display live agent activity, current tasks, and progress metrics in session dashboards
- **Performance Metrics**: Add charts for session duration, message frequency, and agent response times
- **Memory Visualization**: Create interactive memory exploration with search result highlighting and relevance scoring
- **Export Capabilities**: Enhanced session data export with filtering options and multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
- **Theme Support**: Better integration with VS Code themes and customizable dashboard layouts
- **Notification Center**: Centralized view for session events, errors, and important updates

### Extension Architecture Improvements
- **Settings Management**: More granular configuration options for WebSocket timeouts, refresh intervals, and UI preferences
- **Error Recovery**: Better handling of server disconnections with automatic retry and user feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading for large session lists and memory data pagination
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support for all UI components

### Integration Opportunities
- **File System Watchers**: Auto-sync workspace file changes to memory service (Step 20 foundation)
- **Git Integration**: Automatic commit creation for agent-generated code changes
- **Multi-workspace Support**: Handle multiple VS Code workspaces with separate MCP server instances
- **Extension API**: Expose hooks for other extensions to integrate with AutoGen sessions

## Next Steps (Updated Priority Order)

**READY FOR STEP 28: VS Code Memory Enhancement UI**

With the successful completion of Steps 21-27, we now have a comprehensive foundation:

### **Completed Infrastructure (Steps 21-27) ✅**
- ✅ **Multi-scope Memory System**: Proper collections with structured schemas and global knowledge
- ✅ **Operational Search Pipeline**: HybridSearchService with 0.755+ similarity scores and embedding integration
- ✅ **Memory-Aware Agents**: All 8 agent types with persistent learning and cross-session continuity
- ✅ **Knowledge Management**: Automatic seeding, summarization, pruning, and export/import capabilities
- ✅ **Artifact Memory Integration**: Complete development lifecycle memory with Git, builds, and code reviews
- ✅ **Cross-Project Learning**: Intelligent solution reuse, pattern recognition, and best practice propagation
- ✅ **Memory Analytics**: Comprehensive optimization, health monitoring, and performance metrics

### **Current Challenge: Missing VS Code Integration**
**7 Endpoint Integrations Missing:**
- 4 Step 27 Memory Analytics endpoints (`/memory/analytics/*`) - No VS Code interface
- 3 Step 26 Cross-Project Learning endpoints (`/cross-project/*`) - No VS Code interface

### **Step 28 Implementation Phases:**

#### **Phase 1: Memory Analytics Dashboard (Weeks 1-2)**
- Connect `/memory/analytics/report` → Comprehensive dashboard with visual charts
- Connect `/memory/analytics/health` → Real-time health monitoring with alerts
- Connect `/memory/analytics/metrics` → Live metrics display with performance indicators
- Connect `/memory/analytics/optimize` → Memory optimization controls and pruning management

#### **Phase 2: Cross-Project Intelligence (Weeks 3-4)**
- Connect `/cross-project/register` → Project registration UI with tech stack configuration
- Connect `/cross-project/recommendations` → Smart recommendations display with similarity scoring
- Connect `/cross-project/analysis` → Pattern analysis visualization with interactive graphs

#### **Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization (Weeks 5-6)**
- Upgrade existing memoryExplorerPanel.ts with analytics integration
- Add Chart.js/D3.js for advanced data visualization
- Implement real-time WebSocket updates for live analytics
- Create progressive disclosure for complex analytics features

### **Success Metrics for Step 28:**
- ✅ All 7 missing endpoint integrations functional in VS Code
- ✅ Enhanced dashboard displays memory health, optimization status, and cross-project insights
- ✅ Memory explorer shows analytics data, health indicators, and cross-project suggestions
- ✅ Real-time monitoring with WebSocket integration for live analytics updates
- ✅ Interactive charts and graphs for memory usage trends and pattern analysis
- ✅ Memory optimization controls accessible through VS Code interface

**IMPACT**: Step 28 will complete the VS Code integration by providing visual access to all advanced memory capabilities, making the sophisticated backend analytics and cross-project intelligence accessible through an intuitive user interface.

The foundation is solid and ready. Time to build the UI that showcases the powerful memory system we've created!
